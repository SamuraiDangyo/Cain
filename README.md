## SmallChess Rules

The rules are optimized for simplicity.
To have very simple engine code.

- Normal chess rules apply except ...
- 2 reps is a draw
- Pawns move normally but only 1 move
- B/R move normally but only 1 move
- N moves normally
- Q = K + N
- K moves normally
- No underpromotion. Pawns only promote to Q
- No castling
- No en passant
- No 2 step pawn push

Happy hacking !
